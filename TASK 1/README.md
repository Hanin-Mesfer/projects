# Dataset
We used the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle, can be accessed at the following link: Titanic Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
## Problem statement:
Problem statement Given what we know about a passenger aboard the Titanic, can we predict whether or not this passenger has survived? In other words, we are training a machine learning model to learn the relationship between passenger features and their survival outcome and susbsequently make survival predictions on passenger data that our model has not been trained on. This is a binary classfication problem in machine learning as we are classifying the outcomes of passengers as either survived or did not survive the Titanic.
