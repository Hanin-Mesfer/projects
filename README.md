We used the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle, can be accessed at the following link: Titanic Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
# Problem statement:
Problem statement
Given what we know about a passenger aboard the Titanic, can we predict whether or not this passenger has survived? In other words, we are training a machine learning model to learn the relationship between passenger features and their survival outcome and susbsequently make survival predictions on passenger data that our model has not been trained on. 
This is a binary classfication problem in machine learning as we are classifying the outcomes of passengers as either survived or did not survive the Titanic.
# Problem statement:
Survival: Indicator of survival (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class), socio-economic status: (SES: Upper, Middle, Lower).
Sex: Gender of the passenger (Male or Female).
Age: Age in years, can be fractional (e.g., 0.5 for infants).
SibSp: Count of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic (includes brothers, sisters, step-siblings, and spouses).
Parch: Count of parents or children aboard (includes mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, and step-relatives; some children may have a parch of 0 if traveling with a nanny).
Ticket: Passenger's ticket number.
Fare: Amount paid for the ticket.
Cabin: Cabin number assigned to the passenger.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
